about_content: I am an AI Engineer at Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) working on various fields in Machine Learning including Natural Language Processing (NLP, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Computer Vision (CV). On the side, I engage in research relating to NLP where my research interest include [Low-resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07264), [Language Representation](https://aclanthology.org/J19-2006/) and [Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00770).

  # Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.

  # You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as

          A smart radio that uses facial recognition technology to predict user's emotion to modify their song playlist.
        description: Used Deep Face and Dlib models to predict emotions and fatigue level of users based on their facial expression. The system enqueues songs based on predictions using algorithm which ensures a smooth transition between songs based on their characteristics (tempo, danceability etc.) obtained using Spotipy to optimize user's mood and focus level. # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs |

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
