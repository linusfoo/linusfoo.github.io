        #   Disentangling singlish discourse particles with task-driven representation
        description: <h2> Disentangling singlish discourse particles with task-driven representation </h2>  <br/> abstract: Singlish, or formally Colloquial Singapore English, is an English-based creole language originating from the SouthEast Asian country Singapore. The language contains influences from Sinitic languages such as Chinese dialects, Malay, Tamil and so forth. A fundamental task to understanding Singlish is to first understand the pragmatic functions of its discourse particles, upon which Singlish relies heavily to convey meaning. This work offers a preliminary effort to disentangle the Singlish discourse particles (lah, meh and hor) with task-driven representation learning. After disentanglement, we cluster these discourse particles to differentiate their pragmatic functions, and perform Singlish-to-English machine translation. Our work provides a computational method to understanding Singlish discourse particles, and opens avenues towards a deeper comprehension of the language and its usage.

          A smart radio that uses facial recognition technology to predict user's emotion to modify their song playlist.
        description: Used Deep Face and Dlib models to predict emotions and fatigue level of users based on their facial expression. The system enqueues songs based on predictions using algorithm which ensures a smooth transition between songs based on their characteristics (tempo, danceability etc.) obtained using Spotipy to optimize user's mood and focus level. # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs |
