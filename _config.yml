          A smart radio that uses facial recognition technology to predict user's emotion to modify their song playlist.
        description: Used Deep Face and Dlib models to predict emotions and fatigue level of users based on their facial expression. The system enqueues songs based on predictions using algorithm which ensures a smooth transition between songs based on their characteristics (tempo, danceability etc.) obtained using Spotipy to optimize user's mood and focus level. # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs |
